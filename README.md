# Hospital Management System Using Flask
Apr 2024 - Aug 20
<br>
<br>
I developed a Hospital Management System as a web-based application using Flask, a Python micro web framework. The system provides a seamless and user-friendly platform to manage various hospital operations, including patient appointments, medical records, and overall hospital administration. The application is designed to streamline hospital workflows, enhancing efficiency and reducing the complexity of manual management.

Throughout this project, I utilized Flask for backend development, integrated SQL databases for data management, and leveraged Python programming to implement various functionalities. Additionally, I explored Django to gain insight into other web frameworks and enhance my understanding of full-stack development. This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in web development, database management, and creating scalable applications for real-world use.
